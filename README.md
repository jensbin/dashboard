# Dashboard

A dashboard for apps, bookmarks and search engine links. I used [dashboard](https://github.com/phntxx/dashboard) for a long time. Dashboard is deprecated and I liked espacially the search bar feature.

In the end I copied the idea and implemented this one.

The design is embedded in the binary, if you want to have your, copy the `/static` directory and make adjustments. The start the binary with the `-static` parameter indicating the location of the static directory and it will use this handlebars template.
